# Challenge Mobile - Tractian

 Build an Tree View Application that shows companies Assets (The tree is basically composed with components, assets and locations)

## Project Structure
lib/blocs/: Contains the state management (BLoC) for the application.

lib/models/: Defines the data classes used in the project, such as Company, Location, and Asset.

lib/screens/: Contains the main application screens, including the home screen and the asset tree screen.

lib/widgets/: Reusable and custom components, such as buttons and filter widgets.

## Technologies Used
Flutter: Framework for building the user interface.
Dart: Programming language.
BLoC Pattern: For state management.
Git: Version control for project development.

# Future Improvements
If there were more time for development, the following improvements could be implemented:

Performance and Optimization: Improve data loading and filter efficiency.

Animations and Visual Feedback: Add smooth animations for expanding the asset tree and display loading feedback.

Unit and Integration Testing: Increase test coverage, especially for state management and key widgets.

Internationalization (i18n): Support for multiple languages.
